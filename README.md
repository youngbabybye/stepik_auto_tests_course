Homework on the stepik
My life be like
It's times like these that make me say
Lord, if You see me please come my way
Leaving bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price You paid
Feel me like a fingertip (Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip)
Sometimes I fall I slip
My heartfelt desire be more like You
Trying not to quench Your fire with the things I do
